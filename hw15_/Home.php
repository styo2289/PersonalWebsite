							<h3>Winston</h3>
							<p>He is very energetic and can be annoying sometimes. Like Layla, he loves to try and eat different kinds of human foods. He like to lay on your back when you're laying on your stomach.</p>

							<h3>Simba</h3>
							<p>He is sweet but can be very feisty. While he does like pets, sometimes he will swipe when he's tired of them. Although, he does like to cuddle only on his terms.</p>
